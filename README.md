# Vegetable-Image-Classification-with-CNN
In this project I built a CNN image classification model for vegetables that can accurately classify 15 classes of vegetables.

For more information about the dataset, here's the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/misrakahmed/vegetable-image-dataset/

Python libraries I used:  Tensorflow, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Numpy and Scikit Learn

I trained and measured the performance with train and validation data.
Finally, I performed evaluation on unseen data i.e. test data for finding accuracy and f1 scores on which it performed well.

Accuracy = 92.63%
F1 score = 0.9265
