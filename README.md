# Vegetable-Image-Classification-with-CNN
In this project I built a CNN image classification model for vegetables that can accurately classify 15 classes of vegetables.

For more information about the dataset, here's the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/misrakahmed/vegetable-image-dataset/

Python libraries I used:  Tensorflow, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Numpy and Scikit Learn

I trained and monitored the performance with train and validation data.
Then, I performed evaluation on unseen data i.e. test data for finding accuracy and f1 scores on which it performed well.
* Accuracy = 92.63%
* F1 score = 0.9265

Finally, I used the model to predict the class labels of some individual vegetable images for testing its practical usage.
